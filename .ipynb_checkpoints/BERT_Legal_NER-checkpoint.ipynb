Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation Insmed’s fulfillment of its royalty obligations under Section\\xa07.1 below and Insmed’s continued compliance with its covenants in Section\\xa03.5 and the Permanent Injunction and the UK Proceedings Settlement Agreement, Tercica hereby grants Insmed a non-exclusive, non-sublicenseable license or sublicense, as applicable, under Tercica’s entire right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, and import Product for sale in the United States for any Non-Permitted Indication solely for the continuing treatment of any Existing Patient, for a period of twelve (12)\\xa0months from the Effective Date. The license granted under this Section\\xa03.1(a) shall be royalty-free with respect to Net Sales arising from sales to the Existing Patients during the first three (3)\\xa0months after the Effective Date. If any such sales to Existing Patients occur after such three (3)-month period, such sales shall be royalty-bearing pursuant to Section\\xa07.1(a)(i), but only until the date which is twelve (12)\\xa0months after the Effective Date. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation Insmed’s fulfillment of its royalty obligations under Section\\xa07.1 below, and Insmed’s continued compliance with its covenants in Section\\xa03.5 and the Permanent Injunction and UK Proceedings Settlement Agreement, Tercica hereby grants Insmed a limited, non-exclusive, non-    \\xa0    12    [\\xa0\\xa0*\\xa0\\xa0]\\xa0=\\xa0CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED.            sublicenseable, royalty-bearing license, or sublicense, as applicable, under Tercica’s entire right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, and import Product for sale in any country in the European Union solely for the treatment of one or more of the Named Patient Indications, on a Named Patient Basis only; provided that Tercica and GNE each shall have the right to perform audits, either by itself or through its designee, on Insmed’s compliance with any laws, regulations and guidelines applicable to conducting such activities on a Named Patient Basis in addition to, and pursuant to the procedures described in, Section\\xa07.8.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation Insmed’s fulfillment of its royalty obligations to GNE under Section\\xa07.1 below, and Insmed’s continued compliance with its covenants in Section\\xa03.5 and the Permanent Injunction and UK Proceedings Settlement Agreement, each of GNE and Tercica hereby covenants that it shall not, to the extent it has the right to do so, enforce, or permit or encourage the enforcement of, against Insmed or its Affiliates any Licensed Patents in connection with the making, having made and using of a Product for the limited purpose of: (i)\\xa0using, selling, offering for sale, and importing Product for sale in Italy solely for the treatment of ALS on a Named Patient Basis only; provided that each of Tercica and GNE shall have the right to perform audits, either by itself or through its designee, on Insmed’s compliance with any laws, regulations and guidelines applicable to conducting such activities on a Named Patient Basis in addition to, and pursuant to the procedures described in, Section\\xa07.8, and (ii)\\xa0conducting a single non-pivotal clinical trial (i.e., such clinical trial cannot and shall not be used to support regulatory filing or application for Marketing Authorizations anywhere in the Territory), for the ALS indication in Italy, in connection with Insmed’s treating patients in Italy for the ALS indication on a Named Patient Basis. In the event that GNE is the Opt-In Party and the Opt-In Indication is a Diabetes Orphan Indication (an “Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication”), at such time, if any, as GNE and Insmed using their respective scientific and business judgment disagree over whether the continued development of a Product for the Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication is desirable (such that Insmed does not wish to continue development of such Product for the Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication), GNE may elect to take over the development of such Product for the Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication at the sole expense of GNE and, upon notice to Insmed of such election, the Permitted Indications shall be amended to exclude such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication solely for the purposes of the rights granted to Insmed under Section\\xa03.1(c), provided that:    (i) for all other purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation the licenses granted by Insmed to GNE as the Opt-In Party under Section\\xa03.2(b), the Permitted Indications shall be deemed to include such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication;    (ii) GNE shall become, if not already, the Booking Party for such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication and shall have final decision making authority in the commercialization of such Product for such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication in the United States; and    (iii) the profit-sharing arrangement applicable to such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication shall continue only until the payments so received by Insmed from GNE equals the Development Costs incurred by Insmed for such Product for such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication, and thereafter the profit share arrangement for such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication shall terminate and GNE shall pay to Insmed royalties on the Net Sales for such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication in the United States at a rate of [ * ]; provided that, such royalty payment obligation shall apply only in the event that the use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of such Product for use in the Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication would infringe the Insmed Patents, and such royalty payment obligation shall thereafter expire upon the later of (y)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Insmed Patents existing in the United States that would be infringed by the use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of such Product for use in such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication in the United States but for the license grant in Section\\xa03.2(b), and (z)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Insmed Patents existing in a country and that covers the actual method of manufacture or use of such Product (or component thereof) as practiced by Insmed in the manufacture of such Product in such country that is subsequently sold for use in such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication in the United States. If Insmed continues the development and/or commercialization of such Product for such Permitted Indication thereafter, then such Opt-In Party, after exercising its Opt-Out right, shall receive a royalty on the Net Sales of a Product for treatment of such Permitted Indication as further described in Section\\xa07.1(a)(ii).    ARTICLE 7    FINANCIALS    7.1 Royalty Payments for Non-Profit Share Indications.    (a) Insmed’s Royalty Obligations to Tercica and GNE. Insmed shall pay to Tercica a royalty equal to [ * ] of its Net Sales made pursuant to its license under Section\\xa03.1(a) to Existing Patients and which are booked after the end of the three (3)\\xa0month period after the Effective Date, as set forth in Section\\xa03.1(a). Insmed shall pay to Tercica a royalty equal to four percent (4%)\\xa0of its Net Sales arising from use of a Product for all Permitted Indications for which (A)\\xa0neither GNE nor Tercica has exercised its Opt-In right pursuant to Section\\xa04.2 above; or (B)\\xa0subsequent to Tercica’s or GNE’s exercise of its Opt-In right, such Party exercised its Opt-Out right with respect to such Permitted Indication (but where such Opt-Out was exercised only as to a specific region or country, only Net Sales from such region or country shall be subject to such royalty). Insmed shall pay directly to GNE a royalty on all sales made on a Named Patient Basis for the treatment of ALS in accordance with Section\\xa03.1(d) as follows (such Net Sales referred to herein as the “ALS Portion,” and such royalty paid thereon referred to as the “ALS Royalty”):    \\xa0     ALS Portion \\xa0\\xa0 Royalty\\xa0Rates\\xa0Applicable\\xa0to\\u2028ALS Portion [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 4% [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 15%   (iv) Royalties for Other Named Patient Sales Pursuant to Section\\xa03.1(b) and All Off-Label Sales. Insmed shall pay to Tercica a royalty on all sales made on a Named Patient Basis for the treatment of indications other than ALS in accordance with Section\\xa03.1(b) pursuant to subsection (3)\\xa0below. Insmed shall pay to Tercica a royalty on its Net Sales attributable to use of a Product in the treatment of one or more Permitted Indications, which, at the time of such sale: (A)\\xa0Insmed does not have Marketing Authorization for such Product for such Permitted Indication in the country of sale, and (B)\\xa0either (i)\\xa0Insmed has not yet commenced any development of such Product for such Permitted Indication so that there was not an opportunity for Tercica or GNE to exercise the Opt-In right pursuant to Section\\xa04.2, or (ii)\\xa0Insmed has commenced such development of such Product but the Opt-In right described in Section\\xa04.2 has not yet been exercised (“Off-Label Sales”). In such event, the royalty owed to Tercica on such Off-Label Sales will be paid pursuant to subsection (3)\\xa0below. If, following commencement of payment of royalties for such Permitted Indication to Tercica pursuant to subsection (3)\\xa0below, neither Tercica nor GNE exercises the Opt-In right described in Section\\xa04.2 for such Permitted Indication, then upon grant of Marketing Authorization for such Product in the treatment of such Permitted Indication in a given country, the royalty for sales of Product for such Permitted Indication in such country shall be [ * ]. In calculating royalties due under this subsection (3), the following rules shall apply:    (a) Determining Royalties Due for the Non-ALS Portion: The royalties due for the Non-ALS Portion shall equal the “Aggregated Royalty Amount” less the “ALS Credit”.   (i) The Parties shall determine the Aggregated Royalty Amount by applying the applicable royalty rates set forth in Table A below to the Annual Aggregated Named Patient and Off-Label Sales;    Table A for Calculating Aggregated Royalty Amount:    \\xa0     Annual Aggregated Named Patient and Off-Label Sales \\xa0\\xa0 Royalty\\xa0Rates\\xa0Applicable\\xa0to\\u2028Annual Aggregated Named\\u2028Patient and Off-Label Sales [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 4% [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 15%   \\xa0    29    [\\xa0\\xa0*\\xa0\\xa0]\\xa0=\\xa0CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED.           (ii) The Parties shall then determine the ALS Credit by applying the applicable royalty rates set forth in Table B below to the ALS Portion:    Table B for Calculating the ALS Credit:    \\xa0     ALS Portion \\xa0\\xa0 Royalty\\xa0Rates\\xa0Applicable\\u2028to ALS Portion [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 4% [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 15%   (b) Example. The royalties payable shall be calculated as follows:    (i) For the ALS Portion: As set forth in Section\\xa07.1(a)(iii), the first [ * ] of the ALS Portion shall bear royalties at a rate of [ * ], resulting in a royalty obligation of [ * ]; and the next [ * ] of the ALS Portion shall bear royalties at a rate of [ * ], resulting in a royalty obligation of [ * ]. The total royalty obligation for the ALS Portion shall be [ * ] and shall be paid directly to GNE    (ii) For the Non-ALS Portion: As set forth in Section\\xa07.1(a)(iv), such royalty is equal to the Aggregated Royalty Amount minus the ALS Credit, calculated as follows:    Aggregated Royalty Amount:    \\xa0     Aggregated Named Patient and Off-Label Sales ([ * ]) \\xa0\\xa0 Royalties\\xa0Per\\xa0Table\\xa0A   [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 Aggregated Royalty Amount \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0]   \\xa0    30    [\\xa0\\xa0*\\xa0\\xa0]\\xa0=\\xa0CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED.

(b) Royalty Obligations to GNE with Respect to Tercica’s Opt-In Indication(s). In the event GNE does not elect to exercise its Opt-In rights for a given Permitted Indication, but Tercica does so exercise its Opt-In rights for such Permitted Indication, for so long as Tercica has not exercised its Opt-Out right, Insmed or Tercica, as the case may be and whichever is the Booking Party, shall pay to GNE the incremental rates set forth below, on annual Net Sales of all Products used in the treatment of such Permitted Indication, aggregated across all such Permitted Indications as to which this Section\\xa07.1(b) applies:    \\xa0     Aggregate Annual Net Sales for all Products for all such Indications \\xa0\\xa0 Royalty\\xa0Rate\\xa0Applicable [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 6% [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 15%   Such royalties owed GNE shall be deducted from Actual Sales in calculating Operating Profit (Loss). Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section\\xa07.1, Insmed shall pay to Tercica a royalty at the rate equal to [ * ] of its Net Sales of any mass sales of a Product to a buyer who is governmental agency, quasi governmental agency, institution, foundation or other organization or entity and pursuant to a bulk sales contract or other arrangement, but excluding any sales of a Product pursuant to contract or purchase order to distributors in the normal course of business for any intended use.           (d) Royalty Report and Payment. All royalty amounts payable to Tercica (or GNE as applicable) pursuant to this Section\\xa07.1 shall be paid in Dollars within thirty (30)\\xa0days after the end of each calendar quarter with respect to Net Sales in such calendar quarter. Each payment of royalties due to Tercica (or GNE as applicable) shall be accompanied by a statement, on a country-by-country basis, of the amount of gross sales of Product for the applicable indication during the applicable calendar quarter, an itemized calculation of Net Sales in the Territory showing deductions provided for in the definition of Net Sales during such calendar quarter, and a calculation of the amount of royalty payment due on such sales for such calendar quarter in accordance with Sections 7.1(a)(i), 7.1(a)(ii), 7.1(a)(iii), 7.1(a)(iv) and 7.1(b).    (e) Royalty Payment Term. All royalty obligations that apply to sales of Product for use in an indication in a Sale Country pursuant to this Section\\xa07.1 shall extend, on a Product-by-Product, Permitted Indication-by-Permitted Indication, and Sale Country-by-Sale Country basis, until the later of (a)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Licensed Patents existing in such Sale Country that would, but for the license grant in Section\\xa03.1, be infringed by the use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of such Product for use in such Permitted Indication in such Sale Country and (b)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Licensed Patents existing in such Sale Country or other country, that would, but for the license grant in Section\\xa03.1, be infringed by the actual method of manufacture or use of such Product (or a component thereof) as practiced by Insmed in the manufacture of such Product in such Sale Country or such other country that is subsequently sold for use in such Permitted Indication in such Sale Country.    (f) Minimum Royalty. The Parties agree that Insmed’s royalty payment obligations under Section\\xa07.1(a)(i) for sales of a Product to Existing Patients and under Section\\xa07.1(c) for mass sales shall not be affected by any Sales Tracking Dispute, and shall be due and owing at the end of the relevant quarter in accordance with Section\\xa07.1(d) above regardless of any then existing Sales Tracking Dispute. With respect to Insmed’s royalty payment obligations under Sections 7.1(a)(ii) through 7.1(a)(iv), or 7.1(b) or the payment of Operating Profit (Loss), any such Sales Tracking Dispute shall only affect the payment of the portion of the royalties in dispute, and the remainder of the royalties (which shall at all times be at least [ * ] of all Net Sales for each Permitted Indication) shall nevertheless be due and owing at the end of the relevant quarter in accordance with Section\\xa07.1(d) above. Each Party will maintain complete and accurate records in sufficient detail to permit the other Parties to confirm the accuracy of the Development Costs incurred by such Party and the calculation of royalty payments, Operating Profit (Loss), and other compensation payable under this Agreement.           After the termination of the profit share arrangement for such Opt-In Indication pursuant to subsection (3)\\xa0above, the Opt-In Party shall pay to Insmed royalties on the Net Sales for such Opt-In Indication at a rate of [ * ], and such royalty payment obligation shall expire in a given Sale Country on a Sale Country-by-Sale Country basis, upon the later of (A)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Insmed Patents existing in such Sale Country that would be infringed by the use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of such Product for use in such Opt-In Indication in such Sale Country but for the license grant in Section\\xa03.2(b), and (B)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Insmed Patents existing in such Sale Country or other country that covers the actual method of manufacture or use of the Product (or a component thereof) as practiced by Insmed in the manufacture of the Product in such Sale Country or such other country that is subsequently sold for use in such Opt-In Indication in such Sale Country;    (4) the Opt-In Party (a)\\xa0shall become, if not already, the Booking Party for such Opt-In Indication; and (b)\\xa0shall have the final decision making authority in the commercialization of such Product for such Opt-In Indication.            Opt-In Indication at a rate of [ * ], and such royalty payment obligation shall expire in a given Sale Country on a Sale Country-by-Sale Country basis, upon the later of (A)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Insmed Patents existing in such Sale Country that would be infringed by the use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of such Product for use in such Opt-In Indication in such Sale Country but for the license grant in Section\\xa03.2(b), and (B)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Insmed Patents existing in such Sale Country or other country that covers the actual method of manufacture or use of such Product (or a component thereof) as practiced by Insmed in the manufacture of such Product in such Sale Country or such other country that is subsequently sold for use in such Opt-In Indication in such Sale Country;    (4) Tercica (a)\\xa0shall become, if not already, the Booking Party for such Opt-In Indication; (b)\\xa0shall have the final decision making authority in the commercialization of such Product for such Opt-In Indication; (c)\\xa0shall make payments to GNE from the proceeds received from such future sales of a Product for such Opt-In Indication to cover both the royalties otherwise due for such future sales and the unpaid royalties from sales booked prior to such termination; and (d)\\xa0shall reserve all rights to seek recovery from Insmed for such royalty payments made to GNE by Tercica that account for the unpaid royalties from sales booked prior to such termination and Insmed shall have the obligation to reimburse Tercica for all such payments, together with all costs and expenses incurred by Tercica in seeking such recovery from Insmed. Thereafter the profit share arrangement for such Opt-In Indication shall terminate and Insmed shall pay to the Opt-In Party royalties on the Net Sales for such Opt-In Indication at a rate of 4%, and such royalty payment obligation shall expire in a given Sale Country on a Sale Country-by-Sale Country basis, upon the later of (A)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Licensed Patents existing in such Sale Country that would be infringed by the use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of such Product for use in such Opt-In Indication in such Sale Country but for the license grant in Section\\xa03.1(c), and (B)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Licensed Patents existing in such Sale Country or other country that would, but for the license grant in Section\\xa03.1(c), be infringed by the actual method of manufacture or use of such Product (or a component thereof) as practiced by Insmed in the manufacture of such Product in such Sale Country or such other country that is subsequently sold for use in such Opt-In Indication in such Sale Country.            Agreement in its entirety pursuant to this Article 12 due to an uncured Material Breach with respect to more than one (1)\\xa0Permitted Indications by a breaching Party, such non-breaching Party may nonetheless elect not to terminate the Agreement in its entirety, in which event:    (a) the Permanent Injunction shall remain in full force and effect; and    (b) the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect except that to the extent the breaching Party is an Opt-In Party who has materially breached the Agreement by failing to co-fund the Development Costs of a Product for a particular Opt-In Indication, such Opt-In Party shall no longer have such right to continue to co-fund such Development Costs, and the Percentage Interest of such Opt-In Party in such Opt-In Indication shall be reduced to a portion equal to the result of the following formula:    \\xa0         50%\\xa0\\xa0x \\xa0 [ \\xa0\\xa0 Development Costs actually funded by Opt-In Party prior to the date of the Material Breach \\xa0\\xa0 ]  \\xa0  \\xa0\\xa0 50% x (Total Development Costs incurred by the Opt-In Party and Insmed to obtain regulatory approval of such Product in the given country at issue) \\xa0\\xa0    The profit-sharing arrangement (as adjusted pursuant to the formula in this Section\\xa012.5(b) shall continue only until the payments so received by the Opt-In Party equal the Development Costs actually incurred by such breaching Opt-In Party for a Product for such Opt-In Indication (the formula provided in this Section\\xa012.5(b) shall be interpreted based on the same principle set forth in the illustration in Section\\xa012.3(b)(ii)(3)), and thereafter the profit share arrangement for such Opt-In Indication shall terminate and the sales for such Opt-In Indication shall be subject to the royalty payments set forth in Section\\xa07.1(a)(ii) as if such Opt-In Indication was not an Opt-In Indication. The Jury further found that Insmed’s infringement of the ‘151 Patent was willful, and awarded damages to Tercica and GNE of $7.5 million plus the royalty rates assessed in the Verdict Form on sales of IPLEX™ through December\\xa06, 2006 (the “Awarded Damages”). The key elements of this settlement are:    \\xa0  \\xa0 • \\xa0 Insmed will no longer provide IPLEX to patients with severe Primary IGF-1 Deficiency and other short stature indications and will withdraw its IPLEX marketing authorization application for severe Primary IGF-1 Deficiency in the European Union   \\xa0  \\xa0 • \\xa0 Through licensing and development rights granted by Tercica and Genentech, Insmed will have freedom to operate regarding the manufacture, development and commercialization of IPLEX for certain non short stature indications including severe insulin resistance, myotonic muscular dystrophy and HIV associated adipose redistribution syndrome (HARS), subject to opt-in rights and royalty provisions for Tercica and Genentech   \\xa0  \\xa0 • \\xa0 Tercica and Genentech have waived the damages award by the jury in the U.S. patent infringement litigation. Subsequent development costs and profits will be split 50:50, but no royalty will be owed to Tercica.    If neither Tercica nor Genentech opts in, Insmed will pay a 4% royalty on all commercial sales of the approved drug to Genentech. Any cost reimbursement obtained from this program would be subject to a tiered royalty of 4% to 15% shared between Tercica, Genentech and Ipsen.'"

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation Insmed’s fulfillment of its royalty obligations to GNE under Section\\xa07.1 below, and Insmed’s continued compliance with its covenants in Section\\xa03.5 and the Permanent Injunction and UK Proceedings Settlement Agreement, each of GNE and Tercica hereby covenants that it shall not, to the extent it has the right to do so, enforce, or permit or encourage the enforcement of, against Insmed or its Affiliates any Licensed Patents in connection with the making, having made and using of a Product for the limited purpose of: (i)\\xa0using, selling, offering for sale, and importing Product for sale in Italy solely for the treatment of ALS on a Named Patient Basis only; provided that each of Tercica and GNE shall have the right to perform audits, either by itself or through its designee, on Insmed’s compliance with any laws, regulations and guidelines applicable to conducting such activities on a Named Patient Basis in addition to, and pursuant to the procedures described in, Section\\xa07.8, and (ii)\\xa0conducting a single non-pivotal clinical trial (i.e., such clinical trial cannot and shall not be used to support regulatory filing or application for Marketing Authorizations anywhere in the Territory), for the ALS indication in Italy, in connection with Insmed’s treating patients in Italy for the ALS indication on a Named Patient Basis. In the event that GNE is the Opt-In Party and the Opt-In Indication is a Diabetes Orphan Indication (an “Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication”), at such time, if any, as GNE and Insmed using their respective scientific and business judgment disagree over whether the continued development of a Product for the Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication is desirable (such that Insmed does not wish to continue development of such Product for the Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication), GNE may elect to take over the development of such Product for the Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication at the sole expense of GNE and, upon notice to Insmed of such election, the Permitted Indications shall be amended to exclude such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication solely for the purposes of the rights granted to Insmed under Section\\xa03.1(c), provided that: (i) for all other purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation the licenses granted by Insmed to GNE as the Opt-In Party under Section\\xa03.2(b), the Permitted Indications shall be deemed to include such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication; (ii) GNE shall become, if not already, the Booking Party for such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication and shall have final decision making authority in the commercialization of such Product for such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication in the United States; and (iii) the profit-sharing arrangement applicable to such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication shall continue only until the payments so received by Insmed from GNE equals the Development Costs incurred by Insmed for such Product for such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication, and thereafter the profit share arrangement for such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication shall terminate and GNE shall pay to Insmed royalties on the Net Sales for such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication in the United States at a rate of [ * ]; provided that, such royalty payment obligation shall apply only in the event that the use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of such Product for use in the Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication would infringe the Insmed Patents, and such royalty payment obligation shall thereafter expire upon the later of (y)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Insmed Patents existing in the United States that would be infringed by the use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of such Product for use in such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication in the United States but for the license grant in Section\\xa03.2(b), and (z)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Insmed Patents existing in a country and that covers the actual method of manufacture or use of such Product (or component thereof) as practiced by Insmed in the manufacture of such Product in such country that is subsequently sold for use in such Opt-In Diabetes Orphan Indication in the United States. If Insmed continues the development and/or commercialization of such Product for such Permitted Indication thereafter, then such Opt-In Party, after exercising its Opt-Out right, shall receive a royalty on the Net Sales of a Product for treatment of such Permitted Indication as further described in Section\\xa07.1(a)(ii). ARTICLE 7 FINANCIALS 7.1 Royalty Payments for Non-Profit Share Indications. (a) Insmed’s Royalty Obligations to Tercica and GNE. Insmed shall pay to Tercica a royalty equal to [ * ] of its Net Sales made pursuant to its license under Section\\xa03.1(a) to Existing Patients and which are booked after the end of the three (3)\\xa0month period after the Effective Date, as set forth in Section\\xa03.1(a). Insmed shall pay to Tercica a royalty equal to four percent (4%)\\xa0of its Net Sales arising from use of a Product for all Permitted Indications for which (A)\\xa0neither GNE nor Tercica has exercised its Opt-In right pursuant to Section\\xa04.2 above; or (B)\\xa0subsequent to Tercica’s or GNE’s exercise of its Opt-In right, such Party exercised its Opt-Out right with respect to such Permitted Indication (but where such Opt-Out was exercised only as to a specific region or country, only Net Sales from such region or country shall be subject to such royalty). Insmed shall pay directly to GNE a royalty on all sales made on a Named Patient Basis for the treatment of ALS in accordance with Section\\xa03.1(d) as follows (such Net Sales referred to herein as the “ALS Portion,” and such royalty paid thereon referred to as the “ALS Royalty”): \\xa0 ALS Portion \\xa0\\xa0 Royalty\\xa0Rates\\xa0Applicable\\xa0to\\u2028ALS Portion [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 4% [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 15% (iv) Royalties for Other Named Patient Sales Pursuant to Section\\xa03.1(b) and All Off-Label Sales. Insmed shall pay to Tercica a royalty on all sales made on a Named Patient Basis for the treatment of indications other than ALS in accordance with Section\\xa03.1(b) pursuant to subsection (3)\\xa0below. Insmed shall pay to Tercica a royalty on its Net Sales attributable to use of a Product in the treatment of one or more Permitted Indications, which, at the time of such sale: (A)\\xa0Insmed does not have Marketing Authorization for such Product for such Permitted Indication in the country of sale, and (B)\\xa0either (i)\\xa0Insmed has not yet commenced any development of such Product for such Permitted Indication so that there was not an opportunity for Tercica or GNE to exercise the Opt-In right pursuant to Section\\xa04.2, or (ii)\\xa0Insmed has commenced such development of such Product but the Opt-In right described in Section\\xa04.2 has not yet been exercised (“Off-Label Sales”). In such event, the royalty owed to Tercica on such Off-Label Sales will be paid pursuant to subsection (3)\\xa0below. If, following commencement of payment of royalties for such Permitted Indication to Tercica pursuant to subsection (3)\\xa0below, neither Tercica nor GNE exercises the Opt-In right described in Section\\xa04.2 for such Permitted Indication, then upon grant of Marketing Authorization for such Product in the treatment of such Permitted Indication in a given country, the royalty for sales of Product for such Permitted Indication in such country shall be [ * ]. In calculating royalties due under this subsection (3), the following rules shall apply: (a) Determining Royalties Due for the Non-ALS Portion: The royalties due for the Non-ALS Portion shall equal the “Aggregated Royalty Amount” less the “ALS Credit”. (i) The Parties shall determine the Aggregated Royalty Amount by applying the applicable royalty rates set forth in Table A below to the Annual Aggregated Named Patient and Off-Label Sales; Table A for Calculating Aggregated Royalty Amount: \\xa0 Annual Aggregated Named Patient and Off-Label Sales \\xa0\\xa0 Royalty\\xa0Rates\\xa0Applicable\\xa0to\\u2028Annual Aggregated Named\\u2028Patient and Off-Label Sales [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 4% [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 15% \\xa0 29 [\\xa0\\xa0*\\xa0\\xa0]\\xa0=\\xa0CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. (ii) The Parties shall then determine the ALS Credit by applying the applicable royalty rates set forth in Table B below to the ALS Portion: Table B for Calculating the ALS Credit: \\xa0 ALS Portion \\xa0\\xa0 Royalty\\xa0Rates\\xa0Applicable\\u2028to ALS Portion [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 4% [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 15% (b) Example. The royalties payable shall be calculated as follows: (i) For the ALS Portion: As set forth in Section\\xa07.1(a)(iii), the first [ * ] of the ALS Portion shall bear royalties at a rate of [ * ], resulting in a royalty obligation of [ * ]; and the next [ * ] of the ALS Portion shall bear royalties at a rate of [ * ], resulting in a royalty obligation of [ * ]. The total royalty obligation for the ALS Portion shall be [ * ] and shall be paid directly to GNE (ii) For the Non-ALS Portion: As set forth in Section\\xa07.1(a)(iv), such royalty is equal to the Aggregated Royalty Amount minus the ALS Credit, calculated as follows: Aggregated Royalty Amount: \\xa0 Aggregated Named Patient and Off-Label Sales ([ * ]) \\xa0\\xa0 Royalties\\xa0Per\\xa0Table\\xa0A [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 Aggregated Royalty Amount \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0 30 [\\xa0\\xa0*\\xa0\\xa0]\\xa0=\\xa0CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED.

(b) Royalty Obligations to GNE with Respect to Tercica’s Opt-In Indication(s). In the event GNE does not elect to exercise its Opt-In rights for a given Permitted Indication, but Tercica does so exercise its Opt-In rights for such Permitted Indication, for so long as Tercica has not exercised its Opt-Out right, Insmed or Tercica, as the case may be and whichever is the Booking Party, shall pay to GNE the incremental rates set forth below, on annual Net Sales of all Products used in the treatment of such Permitted Indication, aggregated across all such Permitted Indications as to which this Section\\xa07.1(b) applies: \\xa0 Aggregate Annual Net Sales for all Products for all such Indications \\xa0\\xa0 Royalty\\xa0Rate\\xa0Applicable [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 6% [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 [\\xa0*\\xa0] [\\xa0*\\xa0] \\xa0\\xa0 15% Such royalties owed GNE shall be deducted from Actual Sales in calculating Operating Profit (Loss). Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section\\xa07.1, Insmed shall pay to Tercica a royalty at the rate equal to [ * ] of its Net Sales of any mass sales of a Product to a buyer who is governmental agency, quasi governmental agency, institution, foundation or other organization or entity and pursuant to a bulk sales contract or other arrangement, but excluding any sales of a Product pursuant to contract or purchase order to distributors in the normal course of business for any intended use. (d) Royalty Report and Payment. All royalty amounts payable to Tercica (or GNE as applicable) pursuant to this Section\\xa07.1 shall be paid in Dollars within thirty (30)\\xa0days after the end of each calendar quarter with respect to Net Sales in such calendar quarter. Each payment of royalties due to Tercica (or GNE as applicable) shall be accompanied by a statement, on a country-by-country basis, of the amount of gross sales of Product for the applicable indication during the applicable calendar quarter, an itemized calculation of Net Sales in the Territory showing deductions provided for in the definition of Net Sales during such calendar quarter, and a calculation of the amount of royalty payment due on such sales for such calendar quarter in accordance with Sections 7.1(a)(i), 7.1(a)(ii), 7.1(a)(iii), 7.1(a)(iv) and 7.1(b). (e) Royalty Payment Term. All royalty obligations that apply to sales of Product for use in an indication in a Sale Country pursuant to this Section\\xa07.1 shall extend, on a Product-by-Product, Permitted Indication-by-Permitted Indication, and Sale Country-by-Sale Country basis, until the later of (a)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Licensed Patents existing in such Sale Country that would, but for the license grant in Section\\xa03.1, be infringed by the use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of such Product for use in such Permitted Indication in such Sale Country and (b)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Licensed Patents existing in such Sale Country or other country, that would, but for the license grant in Section\\xa03.1, be infringed by the actual method of manufacture or use of such Product (or a component thereof) as practiced by Insmed in the manufacture of such Product in such Sale Country or such other country that is subsequently sold for use in such Permitted Indication in such Sale Country. (f) Minimum Royalty. The Parties agree that Insmed’s royalty payment obligations under Section\\xa07.1(a)(i) for sales of a Product to Existing Patients and under Section\\xa07.1(c) for mass sales shall not be affected by any Sales Tracking Dispute, and shall be due and owing at the end of the relevant quarter in accordance with Section\\xa07.1(d) above regardless of any then existing Sales Tracking Dispute. With respect to Insmed’s royalty payment obligations under Sections 7.1(a)(ii) through 7.1(a)(iv), or 7.1(b) or the payment of Operating Profit (Loss), any such Sales Tracking Dispute shall only affect the payment of the portion of the royalties in dispute, and the remainder of the royalties (which shall at all times be at least [ * ] of all Net Sales for each Permitted Indication) shall nevertheless be due and owing at the end of the relevant quarter in accordance with Section\\xa07.1(d) above. Each Party will maintain complete and accurate records in sufficient detail to permit the other Parties to confirm the accuracy of the Development Costs incurred by such Party and the calculation of royalty payments, Operating Profit (Loss), and other compensation payable under this Agreement. After the termination of the profit share arrangement for such Opt-In Indication pursuant to subsection (3)\\xa0above, the Opt-In Party shall pay to Insmed royalties on the Net Sales for such Opt-In Indication at a rate of [ * ], and such royalty payment obligation shall expire in a given Sale Country on a Sale Country-by-Sale Country basis, upon the later of (A)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Insmed Patents existing in such Sale Country that would be infringed by the use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of such Product for use in such Opt-In Indication in such Sale Country but for the license grant in Section\\xa03.2(b), and (B)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Insmed Patents existing in such Sale Country or other country that covers the actual method of manufacture or use of the Product (or a component thereof) as practiced by Insmed in the manufacture of the Product in such Sale Country or such other country that is subsequently sold for use in such Opt-In Indication in such Sale Country; (4) the Opt-In Party (a)\\xa0shall become, if not already, the Booking Party for such Opt-In Indication; and (b)\\xa0shall have the final decision making authority in the commercialization of such Product for such Opt-In Indication. Opt-In Indication at a rate of [ * ], and such royalty payment obligation shall expire in a given Sale Country on a Sale Country-by-Sale Country basis, upon the later of (A)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Insmed Patents existing in such Sale Country that would be infringed by the use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of such Product for use in such Opt-In Indication in such Sale Country but for the license grant in Section\\xa03.2(b), and (B)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Insmed Patents existing in such Sale Country or other country that covers the actual method of manufacture or use of such Product (or a component thereof) as practiced by Insmed in the manufacture of such Product in such Sale Country or such other country that is subsequently sold for use in such Opt-In Indication in such Sale Country; (4) Tercica (a)\\xa0shall become, if not already, the Booking Party for such Opt-In Indication; (b)\\xa0shall have the final decision making authority in the commercialization of such Product for such Opt-In Indication; (c)\\xa0shall make payments to GNE from the proceeds received from such future sales of a Product for such Opt-In Indication to cover both the royalties otherwise due for such future sales and the unpaid royalties from sales booked prior to such termination; and (d)\\xa0shall reserve all rights to seek recovery from Insmed for such royalty payments made to GNE by Tercica that account for the unpaid royalties from sales booked prior to such termination and Insmed shall have the obligation to reimburse Tercica for all such payments, together with all costs and expenses incurred by Tercica in seeking such recovery from Insmed. Thereafter the profit share arrangement for such Opt-In Indication shall terminate and Insmed shall pay to the Opt-In Party royalties on the Net Sales for such Opt-In Indication at a rate of 4%, and such royalty payment obligation shall expire in a given Sale Country on a Sale Country-by-Sale Country basis, upon the later of (A)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Licensed Patents existing in such Sale Country that would be infringed by the use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of such Product for use in such Opt-In Indication in such Sale Country but for the license grant in Section\\xa03.1(c), and (B)\\xa0the expiration of the last to expire Licensed Patents existing in such Sale Country or other country that would, but for the license grant in Section\\xa03.1(c), be infringed by the actual method of manufacture or use of such Product (or a component thereof) as practiced by Insmed in the manufacture of such Product in such Sale Country or such other country that is subsequently sold for use in such Opt-In Indication in such Sale Country. Agreement in its entirety pursuant to this Article 12 due to an uncured Material Breach with respect to more than one (1)\\xa0Permitted Indications by a breaching Party, such non-breaching Party may nonetheless elect not to terminate the Agreement in its entirety, in which event: (a) the Permanent Injunction shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect except that to the extent the breaching Party is an Opt-In Party who has materially breached the Agreement by failing to co-fund the Development Costs of a Product for a particular Opt-In Indication, such Opt-In Party shall no longer have such right to continue to co-fund such Development Costs, and the Percentage Interest of such Opt-In Party in such Opt-In Indication shall be reduced to a portion equal to the result of the following formula: \\xa0 50%\\xa0\\xa0x \\xa0 [ \\xa0\\xa0 Development Costs actually funded by Opt-In Party prior to the date of the Material Breach \\xa0\\xa0 ] \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 50% x (Total Development Costs incurred by the Opt-In Party and Insmed to obtain regulatory approval of such Product in the given country at issue) \\xa0\\xa0 The profit-sharing arrangement (as adjusted pursuant to the formula in this Section\\xa012.5(b) shall continue only until the payments so received by the Opt-In Party equal the Development Costs actually incurred by such breaching Opt-In Party for a Product for such Opt-In Indication (the formula provided in this Section\\xa012.5(b) shall be interpreted based on the same principle set forth in the illustration in Section\\xa012.3(b)(ii)(3)), and thereafter the profit share arrangement for such Opt-In Indication shall terminate and the sales for such Opt-In Indication shall be subject to the royalty payments set forth in Section\\xa07.1(a)(ii) as if such Opt-In Indication was not an Opt-In Indication. The Jury further found that Insmed’s infringement of the ‘151 Patent was willful, and awarded damages to Tercica and GNE of $7.5 million plus the royalty rates assessed in the Verdict Form on sales of IPLEX™ through December\\xa06, 2006 (the “Awarded Damages”). The key elements of this settlement are: \\xa0 \\xa0 • \\xa0 Insmed will no longer provide IPLEX to patients with severe Primary IGF-1 Deficiency and other short stature indications and will withdraw its IPLEX marketing authorization application for severe Primary IGF-1 Deficiency in the European Union \\xa0 \\xa0 • \\xa0 Through licensing and development rights granted by Tercica and Genentech, Insmed will have freedom to operate regarding the manufacture, development and commercialization of IPLEX for certain non short stature indications including severe insulin resistance, myotonic muscular dystrophy and HIV associated adipose redistribution syndrome (HARS), subject to opt-in rights and royalty provisions for Tercica and Genentech \\xa0 \\xa0 • \\xa0 Tercica and Genentech have waived the damages award by the jury in the U.S. patent infringement litigation. Subsequent development costs and profits will be split 50:50, but no royalty will be owed to Tercica. If neither Tercica nor Genentech opts in, Insmed will pay a 4% royalty on all commercial sales of the approved drug to Genentech. Any cost reimbursement obtained from this program would be subject to a tiered royalty of 4% to 15% shared between Tercica, Genentech and Ipsen.'"
